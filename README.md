Web Development HTML/CSS Assessment

I chose the navigation/navbar design because to fit with the clean theme of the website to match the clean, neutral layout using greys, blacks, whites.
Most of the challenges faced was trying to get the grid and texts/images to be aligned. I had to keep refering back to the relevant lectures and information in my notes and other CSS tutorials online etc.
