                    <p>One of the earliest references to Findochty is in 1440, when the king 
                        granted Findachtifeild to John Dufe. The lands passed 
                        from the Duffs to the Ogilvies of Findlater, and subsequently, in 1568, 
                        the Ord family acquired the manor, port, custom, and fishers' lands of 
                        Findochty, and later built the House of Findochty, known as Findochty Castle, 
                        now a ruin, which stands to the west of the village. In 1716 the Ords brought 
                        13 men and 4 boys from Fraserburgh under contract to fish from Findochty, and 
                        for a time the harbour was busy with landings of herring and white fish. 
                        Findochty expanded as a fishing port through the 1700s and 1800s, and by 1850 
                        was home to 140 fishing boats. But the expansion in the late 1800s of nearby 
                        Buckie provided a better harbour, and some of the fishing fleet had left 
                        Findochty by 1890. Finechty harbour is now used mostly by pleasure craft 
                        and is a good sun spot when the tide is out. A statue known as "The Mannie" was 
                        created in 1959  who 'watches over the harbour'.
